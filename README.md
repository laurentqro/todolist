# Welcome to Happy To-Do List.

**Happy To-Do List is a simple CRUD task manager using all the things I learnt during my time at Starter School and after.**

Here is the learning I applied toward creating this app:

+ User sign in and sign out, implemented from scratch.
+ Welcome email using ActionMailer and Mandrill.
+ Credentials secured using environment variables and the [Figaro gem](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro).
+ Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework + custom styles.
+ Custom typeface with Adobe TypeKit.
+ Ajax for task deletion.
+ Deployment to Heroku. One staging and one produtcion server.
+ Custom domain name with Heroku [happytodolist.com](http://www.happytodolist.com).
+ Google Analytics, using Daniel Kehoe's [work-around for Rails 4](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-google-analytics.html/).
